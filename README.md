Experiments related to the principles of Heat, Thermodynamics and Classical Optics. 

## List of Experiments
1. To determine Planck’s constant (h) using the **photoelectric effect** by measuring the stopping potential corresponding to monochromatic light of different wavelengths.
2. To determine the **Rydberg constant** by measuring the wavelengths of the Balmer series lines of hydrogen using a diffraction grating spectrometer.
3. To determine the elementary charge of the electron (e) and to verify the quantization of electric charge using **Millikan’s oil drop experiment**
4. To determine the **refractive index** of a transparent material (microscope glass slide) by measuring the **Brewster angle**.
5. **Michelson’s interferometer**
   - To determine the wavelength of a laser beam.
   - To measure the refractive index of a transparent material (glass slide).
   - To determine the refractive index of air.
7. To determine the coefficient of linear **thermal expansion** of three different metals by measuring the change in their length with temperature.
8. To determine the **thermal conductivity** of a bad conductor by measuring the rate of heat flow through the material under steady-state conditions using **Lee's method**
9. To determine the **specific heat capacity** of a given substance by supplying it with a known amount of heat and measuring the resulting change in its temperature, using the relation $\Delta Q=mc\Delta T$
10. To verify the **Stefan–Boltzmann law** of thermal radiation by studying the dependence of the radiated power of a tungsten filament on the fourth power of its absolute temperature
11. To study the variation of resistivity of a **thermistor** with temperature and hence examine its suitability as a temperature-sensitive device.
